However, the BuildRequest explicitly specifies that changes must be made to frontend/src/pages/SectionDetailPage.tsx, not frontend/index.ts. The required file was not modified according to the diff.",

The diff shows the correct code pattern ({msg.authorName || 'Anonymous'}) was added to frontend/index.ts instead. The target file SectionDetailPage.tsx does not appear in the modified files list.",
