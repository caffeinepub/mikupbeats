The frontend-file-summaries.txt also references BeatCard.tsx as having updated licensing UI. However, the actual BeatCard.tsx file content is not directly shown in the diff — only a summary entry in frontend-file-summaries.txt mentions it. The BeatDetailsPage.tsx change is confirmed verbatim. The BeatCard.tsx change cannot be fully verified from the diff content provided.",
