## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Exclusive Rights license description text in the beat store purchase UI to accurately reflect the M.v.A Exclusive Rights License Agreement terms.

**Planned changes:**
- In `BeatCard.tsx`, update the Exclusive Rights option description to: "Exclusive Rights grants you sole and exclusive usage rights to this beat. Once purchased, this beat will no longer be sold or licensed to any other artist. You receive unlimited commercial use, unrestricted digital, streaming, and physical distribution, and full rights to adapt, remix, and sample the work. Exclusive Rights automatically include stems at no additional cost. The Licensor retains original copyright documentation but transfers all exclusive usage rights to you as the sole buyer. Exclusive rights transfer is final upon full payment."
- In `BeatDetailsPage.tsx`, update the Exclusive Rights option description to the same verbatim text as above.
- Leave Basic, Premium, and Stems tier descriptions unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Customers viewing beat purchase options will see an accurate Exclusive Rights description that clearly states exclusive usage rights (not full copyright ownership), no further licensing to other artists, unlimited commercial use, included stems, and that the Licensor retains original copyright documentation.
